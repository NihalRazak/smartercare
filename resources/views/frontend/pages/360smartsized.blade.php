                <p style="font-size:17px">Our Advisors kept telling us we need a 360 Solution for our smaller clients. Isn’t there a way to scale the 360 Solution for smaller employers under 500 on-plan employees?</p>
                <p style="font-size:17px">360 Smart Sized is designed for employers with 50 to 500 employees on-plan. We followed Henry Ford’s mass production philosophy for Smart Sized. You can have it just like the Model T, any color you want as long as it is black.  It is built around the Comorbidity Cocktail: Diabetes, Hypertension, and Obesity.</p>

                        <p style="font-size:17px">According to the CDC, 38% of adults suffer from hypertension. 47% percent of men have high blood pressure compared to 43% of women. High blood pressure is more common in non-Hispanic black adults (54%) than in non-Hispanic white adults (46%), non-Hispanic Asian adults (39%), or Hispanic adults (36%).</p>
                        <p style="font-size:17px">Obesity is even more pervasive with the age-adjusted prevalence of obesity among U.S. adults at 42.4%. The prevalence was 40.0% among younger adults aged 20–39, 44.8% among middle-aged adults aged 40–59, and 42.8% among older adults aged 60 and over.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p style="font-size:17px">51.7% of all Americans had at least one chronic condition and almost 31.5% of all Americans had multiple chronic conditions. How deadly is the Comorbidity Cocktail? An analysis of Covid-19 deaths revealed that hypertension was the most prevalent chronic condition in the decedents (65.4%), followed by obesity (38.5%), and diabetes (24.6%).</p>

                        <p style="font-size:17px">Patient adherence to the prescribed care plan is the biggest challenge physicians face. Smart Sized programs for Diabetes, Hypertension, and Obesity were all developed to meet clinician’s needs to improve adherence.  <strong>Remote Patient Monitoring </strong>(<strong>RPM</strong>) combined with AI-Communications, and our Digital Physician’s Assistant are the keys to helping our clients take control and improve their health with greater adherence to their prescribed care plan. These programs were deployed in clinical studies and validated to increase adherence to an average of 74% compared to the control groups 47.3%.</p>
                        <p style="font-size:17px">It is interesting to note one year into the program utilization and participation were at almost identical levels. The exceptionally high success levels are directly attributable to the AI-supported communications platform that uses machine learning to deliver in-the-moment relevant care messages in the preferred method of the participant.</p>

                <h4 class="text-center"><strong>In-Network Care Cost Were Not Created Equal</strong></h4>
                <p style="font-size:17px">Facility fees are often charged at clinics that are owned by hospitals to cover the costs of maintaining that facility. Facility fees range from twenty-five dollars to hundreds to thousands of dollars.</p>
                <p style="font-size:17px">Vertically integrated medical care providers charge both a Professional Fee and a Facility Fee. The pricing spread within your current network will be similar to what you see in this chart. It is like playing roulette with healthcare costs. The house is the guaranteed winner.&nbsp;</p>

                <h4 class="text-center mt-4"><strong>Smarter Search. Smarter Care Choices</strong></h4>
                <p style="font-size:17px">Using our AI-Communications technology, 360 will engage with your on-plan employees to bring consumerism to medical care, to provide them the information they need to make informed smarter choices with their healthcare.</p>
                <p style="font-size:17px">It starts with&nbsp;<strong>Smarter Search</strong>. Our database of in-network providers excludes the highest-priced facilities for Bloodwork, Imaging, Outpatient Surgery, and Urgent Care. Using <strong>Smarter Search</strong>, your employees will save on average 40%.&nbsp;</p>
                <p style="font-size:17px">Let’s do the math.&nbsp;<strong>$5,769 – $414 = a Savings of $5,355</strong>&nbsp;on one MRI in Buffalo New York.&nbsp;</p>
                <p style="font-size:17px">If only one of your employees&nbsp;<strong>accidentally</strong>&nbsp;uses the map, that one incident funds 52.5 employees’ enrollment cost for the year. The lowest percentage of Smart Map utilization we have seen in a group to date is 23% while the average is 44.3%. As a self-funded plan, you can calculate your&nbsp;<strong>Smarter Search Savings</strong>&nbsp;by multiplying the expense of your annual claims by 5.5%. Your result is a conservative number.&nbsp;</p>
                <p style="font-size:17px"><strong>Smarter Search</strong>&nbsp;will do more than pay for the annual enrollment cost of 360 Smart Sized. It will:</p>
                <p style="font-size:17px">– Reduce Your Plan’s Outpatient Care Cost Expense<br>– Reduce the Co-insurance Paid by Your Employees<br>– Reduce Your Employees Out-of-Pocket Expense<br>– Reduce Your Plan’s Experience Rating</p>

It is a turn-key package that does more than pay for itself. It helps you help your employees, your most valuable asset, become physically and financially healthier.</p>
                        <p style="font-size:17px"><strong>With 360 Smart Sized, after years of cost-shifting to your employees to try to mitigate the constant rise of healthcare costs, you can announce you are funding 100% of the cost for a new program that will save them on average $3,000 each.</strong></p>
